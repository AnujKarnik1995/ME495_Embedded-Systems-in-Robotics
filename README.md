# ME_495 Embedded Systems in Robotics
### This repo consists of the homework submissions for ME_495 course taught at Northwestern.

## Overview:
The repo consists of 4 sub-directories labelled homework01-04.<br>

The accompanying videos and a few more details can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/u.northwestern.edu/anuj-karnik/projects/ros-projects?authuser=0) <br>

Each folder has an individual README file containing instructions to run the specific code. <br>

The details of contents in each folder are specified below:<br>
1. homework01: Basic introduction to ROS and a simple turtlebot simulation. <br>
2. homework02: Driving the turtlebot in a figure of 8 and Simulating a 2R robot arm using URDF/XACRO.<br>
3. homework03: Creating a complete differential drive robot in Gazebo using URDF/XACRO. Showcased the use of physics engine by implementing a 'wheelie'. <br>
4. homework04: SLAM implementation using SLAM_Toolbox and gmapping. 

## Software tools:
For these assignments, I've used ROS Noetic, Gazebo and Python 3.6.
