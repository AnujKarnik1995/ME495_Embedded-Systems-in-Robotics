Submission for Homework 1, ME495 - 2nd Oct 2020.

The mover and inspection files have been edited with data from 'crazy_turtle'package.
The rosgraph snap is also shown.

There was a minor goofup with naming and I couldn't resolve it. Instead of 'turtle_control', my package is called 'my_turtle'.

Most of the elements seem to be working, esp the nodes turtle_interpret and waypoint and services.

The rqt_graph does show everything to be linked properly. A snap of the same has been placed inside the 'my_turtle' folder with name "RG_my_turtle.png"

The control logic is wrong. I couldn't get the 'mark' turtle to create the 'X' marks and couldn't get 'turtle1' to go to the waypoints.
Most of my time was spent in debugging so I couldn't enough time to fix it.

The code itself is very poorly written.I apologise for that. I had to do a completer re-write for waypoints node in the last 12 hours.
